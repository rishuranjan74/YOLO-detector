# 🛡️ Safety Compliance Detector using YOLOv8

A real-time deep learning system to detect **helmets**, **vests**, and **people** for enforcing **safety gear compliance** on construction sites, factories, or warehouses. Built using a custom-trained **YOLOv8 nano model** (Roboflow dataset) and deployed with OpenCV.

## 🎯 Use Case

This project helps companies ensure that safety rules are followed in environments where protective equipment is mandatory. The system can run on:

- ✅ **Live webcam feed**
- ✅ **Offline video files**
- ✅ **Static images**

If a person is detected **without a helmet or safety vest**, a **violation alert** is triggered and logged.
